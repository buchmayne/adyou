## Permits ##
I currently don't have a working portlandmaps API key, so for the time being the permits data has to be downloaded manually. The current table in SHRED for permits data is found by using the Advanced tab on PortlandMaps' Permits tab. The query is as follows:
{Type: 'Residential All', between: '01/01/2000', and: '08/13/2020'}
